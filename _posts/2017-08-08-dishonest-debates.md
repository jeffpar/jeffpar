One day, someone at Google wrote an internal memo titled
"[Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf)".

Some days later, the memo was no longer internal, and the person who wrote it was no longer working there.  He says
he was fired for "[perpetuating gender stereotypes](http://www.newsweek.com/who-james-damore-alt-right-furious-after-google-fires-engineer-over-anti-647716)."
Google doesn't get into the details, but Google CEO Sundar Pichai says
that parts of the memo "[violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our
workplace](https://www.blog.google/topics/diversity/note-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai/)."

I doubt that alone would have resulted in the employee's immediate firing.  There is always more to these
stories than we're initially told.  Instead of having a calm, cool, and collected internal dialog about the memo,
it's more likely that tempers flared, angry words were uttered, and ways were parted.

But I don't want to get bogged down in the fall-out of the memo.  I want to focus on the memo itself, and some of the
things that bother me about it.

### The Title

The title, "Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber", feels misleading.  The term "echo chamber" conjures up
images of companies engaging in group-think and cheerleading, where good ideas are drowned out and individuality is
stifled.

However, the memo doesn't provide any real insights into how Google is functioning (or malfunctioning) as an echo
chamber.  The real focus of the memo is that other word, "Ideological."  The memo essentially devolves into a rant
about how some of the author's core ideological values are apparently at odds with those of Google.  And his argument
isn't really with Google -- it's with liberal ideology in general.  I think he decided to use Google as a convenient
scapegoat.

### Corporate Ideology

When companies are formed, it's invariably by people who share almost exactly the same vision and outlook.
What company is going survive their earliest days if the founders and the first few employees are constantly
questioning each other decisions?

So, sure, at a very early age, every company develops specific philosophies that drive it forward.  If you, as a
prospective employee, don't agree with those philosophies, then you don't go there.  You find work somewhere else.

As a company grows, it will usually shift its philosophies over time and try to strike a balance that enables it to
reach the broadest customer base and employee pool.  But no one should expect it give up its core values and become
some kind of bland non-entity, because now we're talking about something potentially *worse* than an echo chamber; e.g.,
a vacuum.

### Personal Ideology

The author says "I value diversity and inclusion ... and don’t endorse using stereotypes."  And then he proceeds
to endorse stereotypes.  Specifically, the stereotypical Left, who engage in political correctness and "shame
dissenters into silence", and the stereotypical Right, who have more respect for strength and authority and
"[tend to be higher in conscientiousness](https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2011/08/18/4462041-liberals-conservatives-and-personality-traits)".

He also engages in some misdirection as to his own ideology, by self-identifying as a "[classical liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism),"
which the naive reader might assume is similar to a modern liberal -- but it's not.  As Wikipedia explains, that
ideology is closer to "libertarianism and to free market capitalism."

I think there are elements of both libertarianism and capitalism that we can all appreciate, but it's clear from the
rest of the memo that the author is really a modern conservative.  And based on the Left and Right qualities he
identifies, he is effectively claiming, or at least implying, that he is inherently more reasonable, more conscientious,
more... you know, better.

He also complains about things that conservatives typically complain about, such as "programs, mentoring, and classes
only for people with a certain gender or race."

Affirmative Action is the classic example.  I'm not immune to the argument that Affirmative Action is a form of reverse
discrimination, but that's a straw man argument.  Affirmative Action was not designed to be non-discriminatory.  It
was intended to be corrective.

If and when the time comes that racial justice and equal opportunity have been achieved, and the world is no longer full
of racist assholes, then by all means, phase it out.  Ditto for gender discrimination and sexist assholes.

### Dishonest Debates

To the extent the memo is a debate, I feel it is a dishonest one.  It's very similar to countless political debates
I've seen on Facebook over the years, and they've really gotten quite tiresome.

What makes a debate dishonest?  When one or more of the parties involved don't come to the table with an open mind.
They aren't there to learn, to be convinced, or to have their ideas challenged.  They are there because they are right,
they have inherent moral authority, and their goal is simply to win the argument and validate their certainty.

Paradoxically, the only thing I'm certain about is that I'm not certain about anything.  I don't claim that that
makes me a good debater, either.  But I'm willing to debate it.
